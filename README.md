# Startup Pitcher
For when you need inspiration when starting a start-up.

## What it is

It really is just a small random sentence generator based off of the words in `resources.json`, for the laughs. You can find it running [here](https://sayabiws.github.io/startup-pitcher/).

I did a little bit of CSS just because, which allowed me to get a little bit back into it because I didn't do any CSS in a huge while.

Also, ~~it pulls the JSON resources every time you refresh the message, because I couldn't fine how to do it another way. The reason behind that is that it's a nightmare accessing the value of the variable `resources` outside of the asynchronous `fetch` call, and also because I'm bad at JavaScript. A good side-effect to this is that you'll always have the latest up-to-date resources!~~ **it doesn't anymore thanks to [@Gladear](https://github.com/Gladear)!**

## What it isn't

An actual idea machine. Please do not try any of the offered start-up ideas for your own company. Or do, I don't care, I won't take the responsibility for it.
